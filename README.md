# Swarm Robotic Orchestra

This repository contains the implementation of a decentralized framework for
collective music generation using swarm robotics principles.

## Overview
The project explores how musical structures can emerge from local interactions
among simple robotic agents, inspired by collective behavior in biological systems.

## Features
- Decentralized control
- Bio-inspired collective behavior
- Rhythmic, harmonic, timbral, and temporal coordination
- Audio/video output generation

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage
Describe how to run the simulations.
